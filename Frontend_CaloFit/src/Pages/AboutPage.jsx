          Our CEO, Aaron Davidson, built CaloFit as a side project in 2005. He
          was following the CRON diet (Calorie Restriction with Optimal
          Nutrition) and being the nutrition nerd/software developer that he is,
          decided to build an app to track his diet. Thus, CaloFit was born. It
          was several years later before he came to the conclusion that maybe he
          was onto something and quit his six-figure corporate job to focus on
          improving CaloFit.

          CaloFit's success has hinged entirely on positive word-of-mouth from
          its users. The company is still – and plans to continue being – a
          bootstrap startup to this day.
